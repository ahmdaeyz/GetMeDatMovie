### [Remarks]
##### *try using search keywords close to the movie name for accurate results
##### *replace the SiteCookie with ur credentials' cookie from [the site](https://egy.best/).
##### *replace the BitlyAccessToken with ur access token from [bitly](https://bitly.com).
##### *for linux so u can download use [axel](https://github.com/axel-download-accelerator/axel) as wget doesn't work.
### [Android]
##### u will need a terminal to run the CLI plus u will need go installed so u can use [termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) installing go is simple as:
> pkg install golang
##### then u will have to install all the project dependencies and compile.
##### the only download manger that seems to work is [ADM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dv.adm)
